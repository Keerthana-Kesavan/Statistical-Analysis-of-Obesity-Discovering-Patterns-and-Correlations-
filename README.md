# **Global Obesity Analysis**

## **Introduction**

**What is obesity?**

Obesity is a complex disease characterized by an abnormally high level of body fat. While body fat itself is not an illness, excessive fat can affect how the body functions. Obesity is often defined using the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing body mass (in kilograms) by the square of body height (in meters). Healthcare professionals often consider a BMI of 30 or above as indicative of obesity. It's important to note that BMI doesn't directly measure body fat and may not accurately assess obesity in certain individuals, such as athletes.

**What causes obesity?** 

Obesity can result from a combination of factors, including genetics, early life experiences, poor diets, lack of physical activity, and inadequate sleep. Essentially, it occurs when an individual consumes more calories than they burn through regular activities and exercise. Excess calories are stored as fat in the body. Unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyles, and excessive consumption of calorie-dense foods and beverages contribute to weight gain.

**Health Side Effects of Obesity**

Obesity is a major risk factor for various health conditions, including:
+ Cardiovascular diseases (such as heart disease and stroke)
+ High blood pressure
+ Diabetes
+ Sleep apnea
+ Musculoskeletal disorders
+ Certain cancers (endometrial, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and colon)
+ Pregnancy complications
  
Beyond these medical concerns, obesity can also have non-medical side effects that negatively impact an individual's quality of life. These may include depression, disability, feelings of shame or guilt, social isolation, and reduced work performance.

### **Trends of Obesity Globally**
Obesity is a critical global issue, and its prevalence continues to rise. The World Health Organization has declared obesity a global epidemic. Over the years, the obesity rate has nearly tripled since 1975, with approximately 13% of adults classified as obese and roughly 39% as overweight.

### **Analysis**
**Data Sources**
We obtained our data from the World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory, which provides datasets related to countries and various health topics. Our analysis primarily focuses on global obesity trends, examining factors such as:

+ Prevalence of obesity among adults (BMI ≥ 30)
+ Prevalence of overweight among adults (BMI ≥ 25)
+ Mean BMI (age-standardized estimate)
+ National adult risk factor surveys covering overweight and obesity
+ National adult risk factor surveys covering unhealthy diet
+ National adult risk factor surveys covering physical inactivity
+ Probability of deaths
+ Raised blood pressure
  
### **Data Cleaning and Preparation**

To ensure data quality and consistency, we performed several data cleaning and preparation steps, including:

+ Handling null values
+ Renaming and selecting relevant columns
+ Merging similar datasets
+ Analyzing and treating outliers
+ Converting data types as needed

### **Data Exploration**

In our exploratory analysis, we investigated various aspects of global obesity, asking questions such as:

***Do overweight and obesity rates vary by region?***\
***Is there a difference in obesity prevalence between different sexes?***\
***How have overweight and obesity prevalence changed over the years?***

Our exploratory analysis revealed significant insights, including the observation that obesity prevalence is on the rise worldwide. We also noted regional variations and differences between sexes in obesity rates.

### **Statistical Analysis**
We conducted statistical analyses, including hypothesis testing, to further understand the data. Notably, we performed two-sample t-tests and ANOVA tests to assess differences in obesity prevalence over time and by region. These tests provided evidence that obesity rates have increased significantly in recent years and that region plays a substantial role in the likelihood of death due to obesity-related diseases.

### **Conclusion**
In conclusion, our analysis highlights the alarming increase in global obesity and overweight rates. The prevalence of obesity is rising steadily, with significant regional variations. Women tend to have higher obesity rates than men. Furthermore, the impact of region on obesity-related deaths is significant, emphasizing the importance of understanding and addressing obesity as a global health concern.

Our findings underscore the need for continued research and public health initiatives to combat obesity, promote healthy lifestyles, and reduce the associated health risks. Understanding the complexities of obesity and its contributing factors is crucial for developing effective strategies to address this global epidemic.
